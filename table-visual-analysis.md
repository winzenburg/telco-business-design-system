# Table Visual Analysis Report

Based on the screenshot captured from http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/table--docs

## Visual Inspection Results

### Table Structure
- ✅ Table is visible and rendering correctly
- ✅ Headers: Invoice, Status, Method, Amount
- ✅ Data rows with invoice data (INV001-INV004)
- ✅ Status badges are displaying with different colors

### Text Colors Observed

#### Table Headers
- **Text Color**: Appears to be dark gray/black - good contrast
- **Background**: White/light gray
- **Readability**: ✅ Good contrast

#### Table Cell Text
- **Invoice IDs** (INV001, etc.): Dark text - appears readable
- **Method** (Credit Card, PayPal, etc.): Dark text - appears readable
- **Amount** ($250.00, etc.): Dark text - appears readable

#### Status Badges
- **"Paid" badge**: Green background with dark text - ✅ Good contrast
- **"Pending" badge**: Orange/yellow background with dark text - ✅ Visible
- **"Unpaid" badge**: Red background with white text - ✅ Good contrast

### Drop Shadow Analysis
- ✅ **No visible drop shadow on the table**
- The table appears to have clean borders without shadow effects

### Potential Issues Identified

1. **CSS Variables Not Loading**: The inspection shows no CSS variables were found, which could indicate:
   - CSS variables are not being properly applied
   - The inspection script may not be capturing them correctly

2. **Badge Color Consistency**: The status badges appear to be using appropriate colors for their states:
   - Green for success/paid
   - Orange for warning/pending
   - Red for error/unpaid

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Manual Color Inspection**: Use browser DevTools to inspect:
   - Computed styles for table headers
   - Computed styles for table cells
   - CSS custom properties (--variables) on root element

2. **Contrast Testing**: Use DevTools Accessibility panel to verify:
   - Text contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
   - Badge text is readable against backgrounds

3. **Theme Switching**: Test with dark mode toggle if available to ensure:
   - Colors adapt properly
   - Text remains readable in both themes

## Current Status Assessment

Based on the visual inspection:
- ✅ **Table is functional and visible**
- ✅ **Drop shadow has been successfully removed**
- ✅ **Status badges are displaying with appropriate colors**
- ✅ **Text appears readable with good contrast**
- ⚠️ **Need manual DevTools inspection to verify exact color values**
- ⚠️ **CSS variables loading needs verification**

## Next Steps

1. Use browser DevTools to inspect computed styles manually
2. Check if CSS custom properties are resolving correctly
3. Verify color token usage in the component source code
4. Test accessibility contrast ratios
