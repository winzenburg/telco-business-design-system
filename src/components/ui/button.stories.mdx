# Button Component

## Design Intent

The Button component is a fundamental interactive element used to trigger actions throughout the application. Use buttons for:

- **Primary actions**: Main call-to-action on a page (use `primary` variant)
- **Secondary actions**: Supporting actions that don't compete with primary (use `secondary` variant)
- **Tertiary actions**: Subtle actions within complex interfaces (use `ghost` variant)
- **Destructive actions**: Actions that delete, remove, or cause irreversible changes (use `destructive` variant)

### When to Use
- Triggering form submissions
- Opening modals or dialogs
- Navigating to new pages or sections
- Confirming user actions
- Toggling interface states

### When to Avoid
- For navigation that changes URL (use Link component instead)
- For toggles or switches (use Toggle or Switch components)
- For selecting options (use Radio buttons or Checkboxes)

## Tokens Used

| Token Category | Token Name | CSS Variable | Usage |
|----------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Colors** | `primary-500` | `--ds-color-blue-500` | Primary button background |
| | `primary-600` | `--ds-color-blue-600` | Primary button hover state |
| | `primary-800` | `--ds-color-blue-800` | Primary button active state |
| | `red-500` | `--ds-color-red-500` | Destructive button background |
| | `red-600` | `--ds-color-red-600` | Destructive button hover state |
| | `neutral-300` | `--ds-color-neutral-300` | Disabled button background |
| | `neutral-500` | `--ds-color-neutral-500` | Disabled button text |
| **Spacing** | `py-2` | `8px` | Default vertical padding |
| | `px-3` | `12px` | Default horizontal padding |
| | `px-6` | `24px` | Large horizontal padding |
| | `py-3` | `12px` | Large vertical padding |
| **Typography** | `text-sm` | `14px` | Default button text size |
| | `text-lg` | `18px` | Large button text size |
| | `font-semibold` | `600` | Button text weight |
| **Border Radius** | `rounded-sm` | `2px` | Button corner radius |
| **Shadows** | `shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)` | Button elevation |
| | `ring-2` | `2px` | Focus ring width |

## Accessibility Contract

### Keyboard Interactions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Activates the button |
| `Space` | Activates the button |
| `Tab` | Moves focus to next focusable element |
| `Shift + Tab` | Moves focus to previous focusable element |

### ARIA Patterns
- Uses semantic `<button>` element by default
- Supports `aria-busy="true"` during loading states
- Maintains proper focus management
- Provides clear visual focus indicators
- Supports screen reader announcements for state changes

### Focus Management
- Clear focus indicators with 2px ring in primary color
- Focus is trapped within button during activation
- Focus returns to logical next element after modal actions
- Loading state maintains focus on button element

## Responsive/Adaptive Behavior

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile (320px+)**: Full-width buttons for better touch targets
- **Tablet (768px+)**: Inline buttons with adequate spacing
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Standard button sizing with hover states

### Density Variations
- **Compact**: Reduced padding for dense interfaces (`py-1 px-2`)
- **Standard**: Default spacing (`py-2 px-3`)
- **Comfortable**: Increased spacing for accessibility (`py-3 px-4`)

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44×44px touch target on mobile devices
- Icon buttons maintain 40×40px minimum size
- Adequate spacing between adjacent buttons (8px minimum)

## Performance Notes

### SSR-Safe Implementation
- No client-side only features that break server-side rendering
- Proper hydration without layout shifts
- CSS-in-JS avoided in favor of CSS variables
- Tree-shakeable with ES modules

### Bundle Impact
- Base component: ~2kb gzipped
- No runtime CSS generation
- Leverages design system tokens for consistency
- Optimized for modern bundlers (Webpack, Vite, etc.)

### No Layout Thrash Guarantees
- Consistent sizing across all states
- Smooth transitions using CSS transforms
- Loading states maintain button dimensions
- Theme switching doesn't cause reflow

## Variants

### Primary (`primary`)
Use for the main action on a page. Only one primary button should be visible in a given context.

### Secondary (`secondary`) 
Use for secondary actions that support the primary action but don't compete for attention.

### Ghost (`ghost`)
Use for tertiary actions, often in toolbars or as subtle interaction triggers.

### Destructive (`destructive`)
Use for actions that delete, remove, or cause irreversible changes. Always provide clear confirmation.

## Sizes

### Small (`sm`)
Use in compact interfaces or when space is constrained (24px height).

### Medium/Default (`md`)
Standard button size for most use cases (40px height).

### Large (`lg`)
Use for prominent actions or when increased touch targets are needed (48px height).

## States

### Default
Normal interactive state with hover and focus effects.

### Disabled
Non-interactive state for unavailable actions. Use `disabled` prop.

### Loading
Shows progress during async operations. Use `loading` prop with spinner.

### With Icons
Supports `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` props for enhanced meaning and visual hierarchy.
