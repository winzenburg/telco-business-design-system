# Design System Team Topology

## Overview

The Comcast Business Design System follows Team Topologies principles to ensure clear ownership, reduced cognitive load, and fast flow of changes. This document defines who owns what and how teams interact.

## Team Types & Ownership

### üèóÔ∏è Platform Team: Design System Core
**Mission**: Enable fast flow for stream-aligned teams through self-service design system capabilities.

**Ownership Scope**:
- **Design Tokens**: Color, typography, spacing, elevation, motion tokens
- **Core Primitives**: Button, Input, Card, Badge, Alert, Icon base components  
- **Infrastructure**: Build system, CI/CD, quality gates, Storybook
- **Developer Experience**: CLI tools, codemods, validation scripts
- **APIs & Contracts**: Component interfaces, breaking change management

**Team Members**:
- Design System Engineers (3-4)
- UX/UI Designer (1)
- Product Manager (0.5 FTE)

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintain design token architecture and tooling
- Develop and maintain primitive components
- Provide self-service documentation and tooling
- Define and enforce quality standards (acceptance criteria)
- Manage breaking changes and migrations
- Support stream-aligned teams with guidance and tooling

### üöÄ Stream-Aligned Teams: Product Features
**Mission**: Deliver business value through customer-facing features using design system primitives.

**Ownership Scope**:
- **Composite Patterns**: Navigation, Forms, Dashboards, Data Tables
- **Business Logic Components**: Service widgets, billing components, account management
- **Application-Specific Patterns**: Page layouts, workflows, integrations
- **Feature-Specific Styling**: Theme customizations, brand variations

**Example Teams**:
- **Customer Portal Team**: Account management, billing, service requests
- **Network Operations Team**: Service monitoring, troubleshooting tools
- **Sales Tools Team**: Quote generation, service configuration

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Build features using design system primitives
- Create composite patterns from core components
- Provide feedback on design system gaps
- Follow design system standards and quality gates
- Contribute back reusable patterns to the design system

---

### üîß Enabling Teams: Specialized Support
**Mission**: Provide specialized capabilities that would be too costly for other teams to develop.

**Teams**:
- **Accessibility Team**: WCAG compliance, screen reader testing, inclusive design
- **Brand Team**: Visual identity, brand guidelines, marketing consistency
- **Infrastructure Team**: Build systems, deployment, monitoring

---

## Interaction Modes

### X-as-a-Service
**Platform ‚Üí Stream-Aligned**
- Design system components consumed as npm packages
- Self-service documentation via Storybook
- Automated quality gates and validation
- No direct collaboration required for standard usage

### Collaboration  
**Platform ‚Üî Stream-Aligned**
- New component/pattern requests
- Breaking change planning and migration
- Design system roadmap planning
- Complex integration support

### Facilitating
**Enabling ‚Üí Platform/Stream-Aligned**
- Accessibility team provides WCAG expertise
- Brand team reviews visual consistency
- Infrastructure team supports deployment needs

## Decision Making: RFC/ADR Process

### When to Write an ADR
- Changes affecting multiple teams
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- New design patterns or standards
- Infrastructure or tooling changes
- Cross-team dependencies

### ADR Ownership by Topic
| Topic | Owner | Stakeholders |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Design Tokens | Platform Team | Brand, Stream-Aligned |
| Core Components | Platform Team | All teams |
| Composite Patterns | Stream-Aligned | Platform (review) |
| Quality Standards | Platform Team | All teams |
| Accessibility Standards | Enabling (A11y) | All teams |
| Breaking Changes | Platform Team | Affected stream-aligned |

## Communication Patterns

### Regular Touchpoints
- **Weekly Platform Office Hours**: Q&A, guidance, feedback collection
- **Monthly Design System Review**: Roadmap, priorities, cross-team alignment
- **Quarterly Architecture Review**: ADR reviews, major decisions

### Asynchronous Communication
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **RFC Process**: Structured decision making for complex changes
- **Slack Channels**: 
  - `#design-system-announcements` - Breaking changes, releases
  - `#design-system-help` - Questions, guidance, support
  - `#design-system-dev` - Technical discussions, development

## Contribution Model

### Stream-Aligned ‚Üí Platform Contributions
**Process**:
1. **Identify Pattern**: Reusable pattern emerges across multiple features
2. **RFC Proposal**: Stream-aligned team proposes pattern for design system
3. **Platform Review**: Platform team evaluates fit, API design, maintenance
4. **Collaborative Development**: Joint development with platform team guidance
5. **Platform Adoption**: Platform team takes ownership for long-term maintenance

**Criteria for Acceptance**:
- Used in 3+ places across different teams
- Follows design system API patterns
- Meets quality standards (accessibility, performance, tokens)
- Platform team commits to long-term maintenance

### Platform ‚Üí Stream-Aligned Changes
**Breaking Changes Process**:
1. **RFC Publication**: Platform team documents planned breaking change
2. **Impact Assessment**: Stream-aligned teams assess impact on their features
3. **Migration Planning**: Codemods and migration documentation prepared
4. **Deprecation Period**: 2-minor version deprecation cycle
5. **Coordinated Migration**: Platform team provides support during migration

## Success Metrics

### Platform Team Success
- **Lead Time**: Time from component request to availability
- **Adoption Rate**: % of applications using latest design system version
- **Breaking Change Impact**: Average time to migrate breaking changes
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Quarterly NPS survey from consuming teams

### Stream-Aligned Team Success  
- **Feature Delivery**: Velocity of feature delivery using design system
- **Quality**: Reduced accessibility/visual bugs through design system usage
- **Consistency**: Brand consistency scores across applications
- **Efficiency**: Reduced custom component development

### Overall System Success
- **Consistency**: Visual and interaction consistency across products
- **Quality**: Accessibility and performance standards met
- **Velocity**: Faster feature delivery through reusable components
- **Maintenance**: Reduced total cost of ownership for UI components

## Escalation Paths

### Technical Disputes
1. **Team Discussion**: Direct team-to-team discussion
2. **Architecture Review**: Present to architecture review board
3. **Technical Leadership**: CTO/VP Engineering decision

### Priority Conflicts
1. **Product Discussion**: Product managers align priorities  
2. **Leadership Review**: VP Product/VP Engineering alignment
3. **Executive Decision**: C-level resolution if needed

### Resource Constraints
1. **Team Planning**: Sprint/quarterly planning adjustment
2. **Cross-Team Negotiation**: Re-prioritize work across teams
3. **Leadership Support**: Request additional resources or scope adjustment
